# Sentiment-analysis
*Sentiment analysis on customer review using the zero-shot technique.*
## An introduction to Zero shot technique
The goal of Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) is to learn intermediate semantic layers and their properties, so that, during inference, a new class of data can be predicted. As an example, a model developed to distinguish between the images of cats and dogs can also identify images of birds. In these instances, the classes covered are known as the “seen” classes, while the unlabeled training instances are called the “unseen” classes.

Seen-class knowledge can be transferred to unseen classes using a high dimensional vector space called semantic space. By taking advantage of the semantic space as well as a visual feature representation of image content, ZSL may be solved by projecting the visual feature vector and prototype into a combined embedding space. The projection of an image feature vector is matched to the unseen class by using the Nearest Neighbour Search (NNS).

Zero-Shot Learning is a subfield of Transfer Learning as zero-shot learning transfers the knowledge obtained from the training instances to testing instance classification.

For a better understand and implementation of ZSL in different scenarios you can read [my article](https://analyticsindiamag.com/how-to-generate-images-from-text-using-dall-e-mini/)

## Details about the project
+ A [transformer](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index) created by Hugging face is been used in this project. 
+ A pre-trained model based on BERT is used as the target model to perform the sentiment analysis on the [data](https://data.world/opensnippets/nykaa-product-reviews-dataset)
+ The output generated by the model is in the form of integers ranging from 1 to 5 based on bad to good.
